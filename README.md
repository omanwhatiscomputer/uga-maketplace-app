# UMPL APP (default readme)

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the app

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### Other setup steps

- To set up ESLint for linting, run `npx expo lint`, or follow our guide on ["Using ESLint and Prettier"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-eslint/)
- If you'd like to set up unit testing, follow our guide on ["Unit Testing with Jest"](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/)
- Learn more about the TypeScript setup in this template in our guide on ["Using TypeScript"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/)

# CSCI 4050/6050: SWE

## Dependencies

```
java 21.0.2-tem
expo 55
```

## For clean standalone development build

android:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

ios:

```bash
# placeholder
```

## Known compatibility issues and pitfalls

- Compile using `java 21.0.2-tem`

```bash
sdk install java 21.0.2-tem   # install Temurin 21
sdk use java 21.0.2-tem        # switch to it
```

- Device SHA1 should match the `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs` configs on Google Cloud Console

```bash
# Emulator SHA1: grab the debug variant SHA1
$ ./gradlew signingReport
```

- (This is for requests to go through properly if using an emulator) For cleartext HTTP on Android, add it directly in AndroidManifest.xml since the app.json key isn't supported. After prebuild, open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ...>
```
